## Overview

This page contains downloadable presentations that you can use or adapt for an introduction to accessibility, how to write statements, or about map accessibility.


### Status of the presentations

Most of these presentations have been used at least once by the Defra Accessibility Team, but they are not really fully tested. You should regard them all as 'experimental'. You can use or adapt them for your own use, or even just use one slide.

### Accessibility of the presentations

We've taken care to provide alternative text, used a good colour contrast and tried to make the whole presentation  accessible in general. However, there will be accessibility issues with the software used to view the slides and we haven't carried out a formal audit of the slides. It's likely that we've missed things. We recommend that you make your own check before use.
