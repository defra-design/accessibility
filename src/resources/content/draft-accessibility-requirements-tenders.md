| Non-Functional | The supplier should provide evidence that an accessibility audit was undertaken by an independent third party to assure conformance to the required WCAG level. | Should | A 'third party' will mean a party independent of the supplier, who has included participation by people who are disabled, against a comparable installed and configured solution, not a base version.<br>In the case of non-compliance, please state who, if anybody, has undertaken an audit to assure accessibility conformance.<br>Reference: Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0:<br>https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/  |

| Non-Functional | It should take an assistive technology user no more than 200% of the time taken by a user not using assistive technology. | Should | EXPERIMENTAL: The aim of this requirement is to avoid a system being technically accessible (conforms to the letter of WCAG) but in reality there is no way a user could actually use it for their role because it would take them too long to actually perform the task. The 200% is a guess and should be validated. |
| Non-Functional | The solution should be compliant with ISO 9241-171:2008 Ergonomics of human-system interaction â€” Part 171: Guidance on software accessibility | Should | EXPERIMENTAL: reference is<br>https://www.iso.org/standard/39080.html |
