## Technical information about this website’s accessibility


[Name of organisation] is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. 


### Compliance status


[Guidance: if the website meets WCAG 2.1 AA standard in full. Guidance ends.]


This website is fully compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard. 


[Guidance: if it meets most requirements (more than half the 50 AA success criteria either conform or are not applicable) of the WCAG 2.1 AA standard. Guidance ends.]


This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to [insert one of the following: ‘the non-compliances’, ‘the exemptions’ or ‘the non-compliances and exemptions’] listed below. 


[Guidance: if it does not meet most requirements of the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, say that it’s not compliant. Guidance ends.]


This website is not compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard. The [insert one of the following: ‘non-compliances’, ‘exemptions’ or ‘non-compliances and exemptions’] are listed below.


[Guidance: If your website is either partially compliant or not compliant with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, you’ll need to explain why. 


This will be due to one or both of the following: 
* non-compliances - this means the content in question is in scope of the regulations, but there’s an accessibility problem with it 
* an exemption - this means the inaccessible content is out of scope of the regulations
* it would be a disproportionate burden for you to make it accessible 


There’s a legally required way of expressing the compliance status of your website, so do not change it. The 3 options are as follows: 


SECTION 10. Guidance ends.]


### Non-accessible content


[Guidance: if the website is fully compliant with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, you can leave the ‘Non-accessible content’ section out. Otherwise, do not change the ‘Non-accessible content’ heading or the ‘The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons’ sentence - they’re legally required. Do not change the ‘Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations’, ‘Disproportionate burden’ and ‘Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations’ subheadings: they’re also legally required. But if you need to list a lot of problems, you can break these subsections up with further subheadings - for example, ‘Navigation and accessing information’ or ‘Interactive tools and transactions’. Guidance ends.]


The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons. 


#### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations


[SECTION 11. Guidance: In this subsection, list: 
* accessibility problems 
* which of the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria the problem fails on 
* when you plan to fix the problem 


Do not include any problems where you’re claiming disproportionate burden, or where the problem is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below). Guidance ends.]


[Guidance: below is just an example text so change it. Guidance ends.]


Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content). We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020.


#### Disproportionate burden


[SECTION 12. Guidance: in this subsection list accessibility problems you’re claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix. Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden forever. If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden may change too. The text below is just an example so change it. Guidance ends.]


Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because some form controls are missing a ‘label’ tag. Our forms are built and hosted through third party software and ‘skinned’ to look like our website. We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a [disproportionate burden](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made) within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing]. 


#### Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations


[SECTION 13. Guidance: in this subsection list accessibility problems that fall outside the scope of the accessibility regulations. The text below is just an example so change it. Guidance ends.]


The accessibility regulations [do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made) if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix [example of non-essential document]. Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.


## What we’re doing to improve accessibility


[SECTION 14. Guidance: publishing an accessibility roadmap is optional. It’s a good idea to publish one if you want to be specific about the order you’re planning to tackle accessibility issues, and there’s no space to do so in the accessibility statement itself. The text below is just an example so change it. Guidance ends.]


Our accessibility roadmap [add link to roadmap] shows how and when we plan to improve accessibility on this website. 


## Preparation of this accessibility statement


[SECTION 15. Guidance: the wording about when the statement was prepared is legally required, so do not change it. Guidance ends.]


This statement was prepared on [date when it was first published].
It was last reviewed on [date when it was last reviewed]. 
This website was last tested on [date]. 


The test was carried out by [add name of organisation that carried out test, or indicate that you did your own testing]. 


[SECTION 16. Guidance: you should describe what you tested and how you chose it. If you get a third party auditor to test your website for you, they should include sampling details in the test report - so you can just use that. Guidance ends.]


We used this approach to deciding on a sample of pages to test [add explanation of how you decided which pages to test].


[SECTION 17. Guidance: publishing the test report is optional, but doing so may allow you to make your accessibility statement shorter and more focused. Many reports are not themselves accessible. If your technical description is well-written then you can omit this section.  Guidance ends.]


You can read the full accessibility test report [add link to report].
