This accessibility statement applies to this website, covered by the Defra Accessibility Resources.

This website is run by the Defra accessibility team. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard

* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
