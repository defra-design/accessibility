A "gov.uk" style page with black header bar at the top and a light grey main section.

The header bar contains "gov.pizza" in large white letters.
There is a green strip the width of the main content below the black header bar.

In the main section there is large and bold text (but smaller than the "gov.pizza" text) reading "Update your pizza preferences"

The body text is 10px and reads "Use this service to:" and is followed by a list which uses pizza emoji as bullet points.
This list contains:
* Update your recorded pizza preferences
* Subscribe to new pizza topping notifications
* Identify allergen content in pizzas

This is followed by an indented line with what appears to be a link (green text with underline) to update your "pasta preferences"

This if followed by "what is pizza? find out here" where "here" is a link.

An image of two men, one feeding the other pizza.

Some more larger bold text reads "Tell me about your best pizza!" followed by body text reading "then press the green button".

A text input has the placeholder text "I love pizza" and is followed by two circles, one bright green and one red.

To the right of the page some bold text reads "Related content" and there is a bullet list of two links to "pasta preferences" and "is pizza a sandwich?"

At the very bottom of the page is a footer reading "Please note - this page has intentional accessibility issues and is intented for use as part of an interview for an Accessibility Consultant."
