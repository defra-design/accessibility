<h1>Defra Accessibility Consultant Interview Page</h1>
<p>This page is intended to be used for job interviews, it has some accessibiulity issues for the candidate to spot. BUT it shouldn't be used as a test!</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To help us understand your technical understanding of accessibility requirements and assistive technologies, at the interview weâ€™ll ask you about accessibility issues on an example page. You should explain how you would go about identifying accessibility issues and pick out at least three issues that you think are important to fix, and explain why.</p>
<p>Please have a look at [this sample web page] and think about your approach and issues before the interview. You will be expected to feedback your responses at the start of the interview.</p>
<p>We do not expect a full audit or detailed review, but your responses should show an understanding of WCAG 2.1 compliance and how you approach such a task.</p>
