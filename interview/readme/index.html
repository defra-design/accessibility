<h1>Defra Accessibility Consultant Interview Page</h1>
<p>This page is intended to be used for job interviews, it has some accessibiulity issues for the candidate to spot. BUT it shouldn't be used as a test!</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>7 days before the interview, when sending the other information, include something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To help us understand your technical understanding of accessibility requirements and assistive technologies, at the interview weâ€™ll ask you about accessibility issues on an example page.</p>
<p>You will be expected to feedback your responses at the start of the interview.</p>
<p>We do not expect a full audit or detailed review, but your responses should show an understanding of WCAG 2.1 compliance and how you approach such a task.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://defra-design.github.io/accessibility/interview">sample web page</a> <strong>before the interview.</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the interview we will ask you to spend 5 minutes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain your approach to how you would identify accessibility issues on this page</li>
<li>pick out four issues that you think are a priority to fix, and explain why they are important</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If required, also include</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a Reasonable Adjustment you can view a <a href="https://defra-design.github.io/accessibility/interview/description.txt">textual description of the sample page</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
